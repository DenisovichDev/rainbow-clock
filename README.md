# rainbow-clock
This is a Rainbow Clock with calendar using the concept of segments and bitwise operations, dedicated to Daniel Shiffman for his love for rainbows. This first little project has reached its completion.

The program was originally created in Processing for mobile phone wallpapers and had later been modified to a p5.js version for live demo generation purposes. [Click](https://github.com/anusha-exe/rainbow-wallpaper-clock) to see the Processing version.
